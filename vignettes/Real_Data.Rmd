## Introduction

In this vignet we will revise all CartesianBehaviour functions using some data of zebrafish (_Danio rerio_) Short-fin (_SF_) and Leopard (_LEO_) from a Novel Tank Diving Test (NTT). The databse is diposible at [NTTZebra](https://github.com/Faccco/NTTZebra), Note tha the the database NTTZebra is a aroud 18MB database, be shure to check your sotorage if trying by yourself to run this example.

To install the database
```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Faccco/CartesianBehaviour")
remotes::install_github("Faccco/NTTZebra")

```

For storage propuses we will use 5 WT and 5 LEO fich from the [ToxTrac](https://sourceforge.net/projects/toxtrac/) trakings. The code bellow show how to import this data from the package to your envirement, but under the vignet we are imorting the data directly to spare storage.
